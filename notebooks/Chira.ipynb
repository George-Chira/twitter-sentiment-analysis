    "\n",
    "1. **`_unit_id`**: A unique identifier for each record. \n",
    "2. **`_golden`**: Indicates whether the tweet is part of a verified, high-quality set. \n",
    "3. **`_unit_state`**: Represents the state of the data (\"golden\", \"finalized\"). \n",
    "4. **`_trusted_judgments`**: Number of times the sentiment has been judged. \n",
    "5. **`_last_judgment_at`**: Timestamp of the last judgment. Not necessary for modeling. \n",
    "6. **`sentiment`**: Sentiment label as a numeric value. This is the target variable for sentiment classification (e.g., 1 = negative, 2 = neutral, 3 = positive). \n",
    "7. **`sentiment:confidence`**: Confidence score for the sentiment label. Could be useful for weighting predictions but not essential. \n",
    "8. **`date`**: Date and time of the tweet. May be useful for time-based analysis but not required for the main task.\n",
    "9. **`id`**: A tweet identifier. Does not add value to the modeling. \n",
    "10. **`query`**: Search query used to retrieve the tweet. Not relevant to the task. \n",
    "11. **`sentiment_gold`**: A verified sentiment label, but it has many missing values. \n",
    "12. **`text`**: The content of the tweet. This is the main feature for sentiment analysis and will need text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, etc.).\n",

    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **Keep**: `text` (for features) and `sentiment` (for labels).\n",
    "- **Optional**: `sentiment:confidence` (for confidence weighting) and `date` (for temporal analysis).\n",

    "### Model Performance and Initial Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Decision Tree Classifier** achieved an overall accuracy of **71.2%**. However, the performance varied across sentiment classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Neutral (Class 3)**: The model performed well, with an F1-score of **0.78**.\n",
    "- **Negative (Class 1)**: The model showed moderate performance, with an F1-score of **0.67**.\n",
    "- **Positive (Class 5)**: The model struggled, with a low F1-score of **0.38**,  due to class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps for Improvement:\n",
    "1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: \n",
    "   - We applied **Grid Search** to optimize the Decision Tree's hyperparameters, such as `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `criterion`. This helps find the best configuration of the model to enhance overall performance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Handling Class Imbalance**:\n",
    "   - To address class imbalance, we introduced the `class_weight='balanced'` parameter in the Decision Tree classifier. \n",
    "By tuning the model's hyperparameters and handling the class imbalance, we aim to improve performance across all sentiment classes, especially the **Positive** class."

    "### Model Performance After Tuning and Class Weighting\n",
    "#### Improvements:\n",
    "- **Class 5 (Positive)**: \n",
    "  - There was a slight improvement in the **Positive** class' performance, particularly in recall (from **0.28** to **0.43**) and precision (from **0.59** to **0.49**). However, this class remains challenging due to its small representation in the dataset.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Class 3 (Neutral)** and **Class 1 (Negative)**: \n",
    "  - The performance for **Neutral** remained strong, with an F1-score of **0.78**. However, **Negative** saw a slight decrease in recall, impacting its overall F1-score.\n",
    "#### Performance Metrics:\n",
    "- **Overall Accuracy**: **70.7%** (slightly lower than the initial 71.2%)\n",
    "- **Class-wise Performance**:\n",
    "  - **Negative (Class 1)**: Precision = 0.70, Recall = 0.62, F1-Score = 0.66\n",
    "  - **Neutral (Class 3)**: Precision = 0.75, Recall = 0.82, F1-Score = 0.78\n",
    "  - **Positive (Class 5)**: Precision = 0.49, Recall = 0.43, F1-Score = 0.45 \n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "- While tuning improved the performance of the Positive class, the overall accuracy slightly decreased due to the balancing of class weights. The improvement in recall for the Positive class indicates the model is now more sensitive to minority class examples, but there is still room for improvement, particularly for this class."

    "### Model 2: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating the **Decision Tree** model, we observed that while it provided decent results, there are some limitations. \n",
    "#### Why XGBoost?\n",
    "XGBoost is an advanced ensemble learning algorithm based on **Gradient Boosting**. It builds multiple decision trees sequentially, where each tree attempts to correct the errors of the previous one. This boosting technique helps the model generalize better and reduces overfitting, making XGBoost more powerful than a standard Decision Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next step, we will build the XGBoost model using the same **TF-IDF features** that we used for the Decision Tree and evaluate its performance on the test set.\n"

    "### XGBoost Model Evaluation and Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "The **XGBoost model** achieved an accuracy of **73.7%**, an improvement over the Decision Tree's **71.2%**. The main performance improvements are seen in precision and recall for certain classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Negative Sentiment (Class 1)**:\n",
    "   - **Precision improved** from 0.69 (Decision Tree) to **0.75**, meaning XGBoost made fewer incorrect Negative predictions.\n",
    "   - **Recall** remained similar, with a slight drop from 0.66 to **0.63**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Neutral Sentiment (Class 3)**:\n",
    "   - **Recall increased significantly** from 0.84 to **0.90**, improving the model’s ability to correctly identify Neutral sentiment.\n",
    "   - The **F1-score** improved from 0.78 to **0.81**, showing an overall better balance between precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Positive Sentiment (Class 5)**:\n",
    "   - **Precision improved** from 0.59 to **0.73**, indicating more accurate predictions of Positive sentiment.\n",
    "   - **Recall** remained low at **0.29** (previously 0.28), showing that the model still struggles with identifying Positive sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, **XGBoost outperforms the Decision Tree** in terms of precision, particularly for Negative and Positive sentiment, while also improving recall for Neutral sentiment. The model still faces challenges in identifying Positive sentiment correctly, especially in recall."
